# Contact Tracing Program

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic of today, everyone is doing their best to stop the 
spread of the virus by staying home.  Experts already stated that we need to wait 
until COVID-19 cases actually start to decline over several weeks before 
reopening businesses and going back to school and work. But once people start 
resuming their normal routines, it will be essential to trace contacts of a 
newly infected patient to contain emerging clusters of COVID-19 infections. 
Contact tracing is a key strategy for preventing further spread of the virus 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This weekâ€™s challenge 
is to write a Contact Tracing Program that produces a contact report of an infected 
patient.

 

Requirements:
Write a program that will allow a user to enter in:
a name, 
an email address,
a phone number, 
an address (city & state),
at least one symptom:
name of a symptom,
number of days with this symptom
At least one contacted person:
a name,
an email address,
a phone number
 

Functionalities

Build as an Object-Oriented Program
must contain multiple classes, implement composition
use inheritance if/when possible
all instance variables must be accessed via methods (getters & setters)
The main method of the program should handle all user interaction
The data must be kept in a collection (i.e. Arrays, Array List, or Hash Map)
Must check for all symptoms
Ensure that users have met the minimum amount of items requirements
Make the report look pretty!
 

Common signs and symptoms can include:

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Tiredness
Aches
Chills
Sore throat
Loss of smell
Loss of taste
Headache
Diarrhea
Severe vomiting
